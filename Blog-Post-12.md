# Blog post: Week 12

## Recap of experience at FCAD end of year event

At the FCAD senior celebration, we got a chance to see seniors in FCAD astronomy departments present their research work, and of course our 341 class presented our final findings. Each presenter only had about five minutes, so that was certainly very tight. Presentations of course were given over Zoom, viewed as a shared screen rather than printed and presented physically; all things considered this went rather smoothly (although Zoom applause ended up being rather awkward). Johari and I presented second within the 341 block, right after Kenneth and JÃ©a. Overall I enjoyed the senior celebration and being able to give my talk in this format although I am a little sad I wasn't able to see a physical poster and it didn't quite feel like a celebration.

## How was presenting poster?

I feel mostly positive about my performance last Wednesday; it was hard to remember all the things I had planned to say during practice and which order I was supposed to say them in, but all things considered I think my audience got most of the ideas I attempted to convey. I only received one question, and it was related to the aliasing problem seen in my distribution of periods- essentially all of my detected periods fell into a single bin, which disagrees with how periods should naturally spread, even if the real periods are spread about this value. I don't quite remember what the exact question was but I felt that my answer was satisfactory. It was also nice to be able to see the final products of all my classmates' as well as the projects other FCAD seniors are working on.

## How did course experience compare with expectation?

For obvious reasons this semester went way different from all my initial expectations. I'll start with the first half of the semester as this went more normal. This portion actually went slower than I had expected; since we had already studied the same data reduction algorithms as in 337, I was surprised we spent so much time on going through the process of sorting, bias removal, flatfielding and align/stacking algorithms, which took up time through around early March. The challenge during this time was instead on working on the scientific writing portion of the class, which was definitely my weak point going in. I think the early practice did help some, but I still have lots to improve on. Post-quarantine technical work of course covered photometry and getting results. This was a lot harder for me for a number of reasons- new techniques and software were introduced, which I had difficulty understanding or installing, added onto struggling with finding motivation during quarantine. However in the end I do feel like I got a good grasps of the involved concepts and of course my end product turned out well after a few nights of worrying it might not.

In short, I expected the first half of the course to be a bit more difficult and the second half not to be so much, although I suppose in this sense it's not been so different from my other research experiences. The main difference here was that most components were guided whereas my REU for example mostly had me figuring out what to do and how to do it; while it's hard to really compare them I think I enjoy the class model for where I am currently since even for the troubles I had during this class, during my REU last summer I was often simply lost.

Thanks for teaching this class, Kim and Sarah! Hope you have an excellent summer! :)
