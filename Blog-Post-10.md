#Blog Post Week 10

## This Week's Work

### Figure Updates, Computing Periods, Table Matching

### Attempts at describing relations

### Goals and directions for poster draft

Last week as part of the writing portion of the project my partner and I worked on an outline for our final poster to present our findings. Now the goal for this week is to turn the outline into a working draft, i.e. in poster format. Based on feedback we received during class last Wednesday, it seems the current iteration of the outline is in very good shape, although it did have some flaws in certain places. Based on this feedback as well as other discussion about presentations that happened during class, we'll attempt to work on the following:

* The title and abstract/introduction need to be clearer about what our scientific goals are.
* Introduction and abstract are too lengthy and dense; rather than draw out the context to explain everything, it's better to summarize in just a few sentences in order to draw more attention to analysis, conclusions, and figures.
* Certain details need to be filled in with the data/analysis sections, e.g. why don't we perform dark current subtraction on our images?
* The outline referred to several figures we might include in the final presentation. However, it was devoid of any actual figures despite we're at the point now where we can produce light curves, periodograms, etc. Thus, we should try to get a figure or two, even if we cannot get all of the figures we'd like.
* There are many archetypes of posters as seen in last week's slides. We'll need to make a decision for what sort of graphical appearance will make our poster enticing to read and straightforward to understand.

At the moment, work on these is in progress, and I hope once they are complete we will have a nice looking presentation ready for the final!
